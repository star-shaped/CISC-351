The project enclosed in this folder was work submitted for the completion of Assignment
2 in CISC 351, during the Winter 2023 semester, at Queen's University. The goal of the
assignment was to create a deep learning pipeline for the purposes of classifying
pictures of fashion items, such as shoes or clothing, into one of 11 categories. The pipeline
begins with some basic data exploration, and ends with us creating a basic, 
untuned convolutional neural network (CNN), which performed quite well.

The second part of the assignment involved two ways of improving the neural network. The
first method we tried was tuning the learning rate of the ADAM optimizer, which improved performance
significantly, while the second method involved data augmentation (creating new training data out of
the already existing images by augmenting them slightly, for example rotating them, or inverting
the colours), which didn't improve performance, but did improve the previous model overfitting slightly.
